        <h3>Interview Plans</h3>
        <p>I use these interview plans to help conduct user research and gather feedback to inform the design process. 
        This helps me understand the needs and pain points of users, and design solutions that meet their needs.</p>

        <h3>User Flows</h3>
          <p>I use user flows to create wireframes and prototypes, which allows me to test and iterate on designs before they are finalized. 
            This helps me identify and address any usability issues early on in the design process.</p>

        <h3>Figma</h3>
          <p>My ability to work around Figma allows me to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces that are easy to navigate. 
            I pay attention to details such as typography, spacing and color to create a cohesive design.</p>
